This MATLAB package is a collection of scripts allowing to generate figures in the paper [1]. This paper puts forward a generalization of the short-time Fourier-based Synchrosqueezing Transform using a new local estimate of instantaneous frequency. Such a technique enables not only to achieve a highly concentrated time-frequency representation for a wide variety of AM-FM multicomponent signals but also to reconstruct their modes with a high accuracy.

For Figure 5, one need some functions, including the fast EMD that can be downloaded from https://github.com/HaizhaoYang/SST_compare/blob/master/comparison/
