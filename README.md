This MATLAB package is a collection of scripts allowing to generate figures in the paper [1]. This paper puts forward a generalization of the short-time Fourier-based Synchrosqueezing Transform using a new local estimate of instantaneous frequency. Such a technique enables not only to achieve a highly concentrated time-frequency representation for a wide variety of AM-FM multicomponent signals but also to reconstruct their modes with a high accuracy.
